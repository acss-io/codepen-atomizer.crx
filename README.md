## How to install?

> **Q: Why the extension is not available on the Chrome Web Store?** Because, I am unwilling to pay a one-time fee of $5 to setup the account.

## How to use?
If the extension is enabled (default), then you could [create a new pen on Codepen](http://codepen.io/pen) and start writing atomic classes in your HTML and the Atomic CSS will be genrated automatically in the CSS panel. Refer the following GIF,
